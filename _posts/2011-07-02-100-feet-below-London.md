> The tunnels are eeires and somehow unsettling, like pictures of the deep ocean floor or the craters upon Mars.

Yesterday I finished the (refreshingly) concise [London Under](http://www.amazon.co.uk/London-Under-Peter-Ackroyd/dp/0701169915) by Peter Ackroyd. It’s one of those books where at every page turn you make a mental note to Google a particular story. Inevitably I usually forget.

On this occasion one such story I did remember is journalist’s Duncan Campbell’s bike ride into the sprawling network of hidden Government tunnels - 100 feet below central London.

> In 1980, the investigative journalist Duncan Campbell entered this network via a manhole on a traffic island in Bishopsgate. He rode a collapsible bike around it, apparently while guards were having their tea, photographed it, and described it in an article published in the Christmas 1980 edition of this magazine.

I found the photographs tricky to track down but thanks to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_citadels_under_London) and [The Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20050422114116/http://www.iptvreports.mcmail.com/Tunneltrip.htm) I uncovered these photos by Chris Davies with notes by Duncan Campbell.
