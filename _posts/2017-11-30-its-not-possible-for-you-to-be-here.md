_Warning some spoilers._

The 2016 science fiction film Passengers is full of bad design. More specifically bad interaction design. There is a lot on the web about all the great [user interfaces portrayed in sci-fi movies](http://sciencefictioninterfaces.tumblr.com/). But there is very little on the sorry state of interaction design. OK so some people may argue that any interaction design in a film is simply there to fulfill a plot device and it's really not worth spending anytime thinking about it. But, uh, I'm going to anyway.

The protagonist Jim is travelling with thousands of other passengers onboard a space ship heading to colonise a new planet. From Earth the journey will take 120 years and so the people on the ship have to travel the majority of the journey in controlled hibernation. However due to a technical error Jim wakes up 90 years too early. We then follow Jim as he tries to figure out how to go back into hibernation. We see him interacting with the ship&#8217;s computers via beautifully designed voice recognition and touch screen interfaces. Seemingly a great deal of time has been spent by the ship&#8217;s designers creating these interfaces. However, and here&#8217;s the rub, they spent no time designing for the scenario of a passenger waking up too early. The designers assume that the &#8216;Hibernation pods are fail-safe, they never malfunction&#8217;. The computer functions as normal but when confronted with this error has no way to do deal with it. In fact its response is &#8216;It's not possible for you to be here.&#8217; Uh oh. That&#8217;s  less useful than a &#8216;404 - page not found&#8217;. 

Jim frantically tries to get help by sending a message to the 'Homestead Company' back on Earth. Another smooth voice and touch screen interaction occurs where Jim records and sends his video message. However it&#8217;s only _after_ the message has been sent that the computer respond &#8216;&#8216;Message sent. Message will arrive in 19 years. Earliest reply in 55 years. We apologise for the delay. That will be $6,012&#8217;.

Well the message is transparent but it would have been more useful to know this before recording and sending the video. Feedback needs to be timely. Clearly Jakob Nielsen's [10 principles for interaction design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) have got lost over the years.

The movie continues from one piece of bad design to another. Some more banal than others. The coffee machine requires Jim to login so it can determine his privileges. Despite obtaining his details the machine still presents options that aren&#8217;t available for his class &#8216;Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme is reserved for gold-class passengers&#8217;. After trying numerous different options he finally figures out that only bog standard coffee is available for the likes of him.

The stories in science fiction are often used to express the fears of the current day. In this film the faceless bad guys may be be the &#8216;Homestead company&#8217; but ultimately, bad design is the root cause of the problems. Don't blame the CEO, the scientists or the engineers. Blame the designers.

(Also blame Jim. [Jim is a real creep](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/15/passengers-review-spaceship-romcom-scuppered-chris-pratt-jennifer-lawrence)).
