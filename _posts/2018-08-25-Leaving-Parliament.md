title: Two years at Parliament

In May I left the Parliamentary Digital Service to join the digital team at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

In my two years at Parliament I was fortunate to work with some good people on a number of really challenging but important projects. This included introducing, for the first time, a visual identity for UK Parliament to help it communicate better to a broader audience and also being part of the team working on a new website for Parliament, from discovery research through to live. The work on the website is ambitious and still ongoing and it's laying  foundations to help make Parliament more transparent and accessible for the future. 

Below are a few links related to my time there:
