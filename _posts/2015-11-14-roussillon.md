 In October I visited [Roussillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roussillon,_Vaucluse), a beautiful small village in Provence with its buildings painted in [ochre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochre) pigment from the surrounding clays hills. The ochre buildings contrasted next to the blue skies, green hills and the long Autumn shadows made it irresistible not to photograph. Here's just a few I took (with a complimentary [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jackcraig/) filter of course).
