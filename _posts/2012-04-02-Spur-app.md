I came across [Spur App](http://www.spurapp.com/) from [Zurb](http://www.zurb.com) for the first time today. It’s a free tool to help web designers critique their work. We’ve all experienced the dreaded _I’ve- been-staring-at-this-for-too-long_ feeling. Spur App gives you 8 tools to methodically re-examine your work again. 

All the processes are easy to recreate in Photoshop (in fact I’m sure, like me, you do some of them anyway) so whether I’ll stick with Spur App long term I’m not sure. However I think it’s good discipline and a useful way to share and rationalise your decisions with other people.
