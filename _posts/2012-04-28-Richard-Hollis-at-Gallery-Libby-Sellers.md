Some photos from the excellent [Richard Hollis](http://www.richardhollis.com/) exhibition at [Gallery Libby Sellers](http://www.libbysellers.com/) in London. Hollis is a graphic designer/writer/teacher. If you have ever studied design you will probably know him as both author of [this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Graphic-Design-Concise-History-World/dp/0500203474) and designer of [this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ways-Seeing-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/014103579X/).

He founded and taught at the West of England College of Art in 1964\. In this [Eye interview](http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=130&fid=574) he describes their aim of starting “a new Bauhaus in Bristol”. Interestingly (for me) both my parents attended this college in the late sixties (although too late to be taught by Hollis).
