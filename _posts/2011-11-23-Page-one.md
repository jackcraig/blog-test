[Page One](http://www.takepart.com/pageone), a fly-on-the-wall documentary at the New York Times is already on the [BBC iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b017j25x/Storyville_20112012_Deadline_The_New_York_Times/) (it was in cinemas just a few months back).

I’m currently reading [Here Come Everybody](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_Everybody) by Clay Shirky (who makes an appearance in this film) and it’s a great companion piece to the book.

In future decades this film will serve as an important record of where we were.
