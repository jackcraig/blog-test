Last bank holiday weekend I finally visited the [Patrick Caulfield Exhibition at the Tate Britain](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/patrick-caulfield) before it closed. It was a retrospective of work from the 1960s up until just before his death in 2005\. It was strange to see some of his later pieces that he must have been working on whilst I was studying him for my GCSEs over 10 years ago. His work was an inspiration for me to persevere and to carry on studying art and go into graphic design. It was great to finally see, first hand, some of the artwork that I had meticulously studied all those years ago. It doesn’t need to be be said that it was even more stunning to see the real thing.
