I've moved my website to Github Pages and I'm now using the static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Excuse the appearance. I've stripped the site of styling and content to hopefully force myself to redesign it (iteratively overtime) and to update it  more often. Old blog posts will eventually be migrated over. My design portfolio isn't on a public facing domain. Maybe I will change that in the future.

 Using Jekyll, it feels good to be free from third party systems and take control of my code again. To get to this point I've used a combination of Anna Debenham's 24 ways article '[Getting started with Github pages](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages)' and Barry Clark's '[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)' starter repo. The Web Ahead podcast also has a good [introductory episode on Jekyll](http://5by5.tv/webahead/54). This post is my first mark, I'm looking forward to exploring it more.
