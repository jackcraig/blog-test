I'm Jack a digital designer based in London. I specialise in interaction and UI design. 

I work with design tools such as Photoshop and Sketch as well as in-browser using HTML, CSS/SASS and a little bit of Javascript/jQuery. 

I work full time as design lead at [The Parliamentary Digital Service](https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/). Previously I've worked as a designer at the [Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) (including its sub brands such as [Wellcome Collection](http://wellcomecollection.org/), [Wellcome Library](http://wellcomelibrary.org/), [Mosaic](http://mosaicscience.com/)), [The Evening Standard](http://www.standard.co.uk/), [The Independent](The Independent), e-Bay inc. (what used to be e-Dialog) and an internship at [Wallpaper*](http://www.wallpaper.com/).

This site is a work in progress.
