I'm Jack, a designer based in London. I specialise in interaction and UI design. 

I use tools such as Photoshop and Sketch as well as HTML, CSS/SASS and a little bit of Javascript/jQuery for in-browser prototypes. 

I work full time as design lead at the [Victoria and Albert Museum] (https://www.vam.ac.uk/). Previously I've worked as design lead at [The Parliamentary Digital Service](https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/) and as designer at the [Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) (including its sub brands such as [Wellcome Collection](http://wellcomecollection.org/), [Wellcome Library](http://wellcomelibrary.org/), [Mosaic](http://mosaicscience.com/)), [The Evening Standard](http://www.standard.co.uk/), [The Independent](The Independent), e-Bay inc. (what used to be e-Dialog) and an internship at [Wallpaper*](http://www.wallpaper.com/).

This site is a work in progress.
